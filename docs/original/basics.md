# Fáilte | Welcome!

Welcome to Duolingo's Irish course! In this course you will learn the official standard (**an Caighdeán Oifigiúil**) of Irish. But note, this is a written, and not a spoken standard. Irish is spoken in three main dialects, corresponding to three Irish provinces of Munster (south), Ulster (north), and Connacht (west). The audio in this course was recorded by a native speaker of the Connacht dialect.

So what makes Irish different? What might challenge you as you try to learn? Well, tonnes of things! To be honest, even the basics of Irish are very different from what you're probably used to.

The best advice we can give is that with Irish, learning things off by heart and trying to base your learning on grammar will only get you so far. It's a very irregular language, and most rules that try to generalise come with many exceptions.

Just take it as slowly as you need to, and nothing should challenge you very much. There is a really good article about some of the more fascinating peculiarities here: https://multikulti.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/10-reasons-why-irish-is-an-absolutely-awesome-language/

We'll also address a couple below. So let's get started then!

#### Intro

The Irish alphabet is short and sweet:

**a b c d e f g h i l m n o p r s t u**

The vowels can take an added accent, the **fada** (pronounced 'foddah'):

**á é í ó ú**

The _fada_ lengthens and alters the sound on the vowel.

The rest of the English alphabet, **j k q v w x y z**, especially v, is gradually being naturalised into Irish due to the many loanwords we take in.

#### Word Order

Most English sentences use the "Subject-Verb-Object" word order. For example, in the sentence _He eats food_, _he_ is the subject, _eats_ is the verb, and _food_ is the object.

In Irish, a slightly different word order is used: "V-S-O". Here is the same sentence in Irish: **Itheann sé bia**. The verb in this sentence is **itheann** (a form of the verb _to eat_), the subject is **sé** (_he_), and the object is **bia** (_food_).

In summary: Irish sentences start with their verbs!

* **Ith**im _bia_ | I **eat** _food_
* **Itheann** an fear _bia_ | The man **eats** _food_
* **Ólann** sí _bainne_ | She **drinks** _milk_

#### To be, or not to be...

Irish makes it interesting when you want to say what something "is", because you need to choose the right version of the verb "to be"! There are two versions. called **bí** and **an chopail**.

* **Bí** is Irish for _to be_, and is one of only eleven irregular verbs in the whole language. _That's handy!_

| bí             | to be           |
|----------------|-----------------|
| tá mé/táim     | I am            |
| tá tú          | you (sing.) are |
| tá sé          | he/it is        |
| tá sí          | she/it is       |
| tá muid/táimid | we are          |
| tá sibh	       | you (pl.) are   |
| tá siad	       | they are        |

> Notes: tá + mé (I) = táim, tá + muid (we) = táimid. These contractions are called the synthetic form.

* **An chopail** (the _copula_) is a defective verb with its own funky grammar. It doesn't even follow the normal word order rules! The word you are talking about goes in the middle.

| copail           | copula          |
|------------------|-----------------|
| is ... mé        | I am            |
| is ... tú        | you (sing.) are |
| is ... é         | he/it is        |
| is ... í         | she/it is       |
| is ... sinn/muid | we are          |
| is ... sibh      | you (pl.) are   |
| is ... iad       | they are        |

The copula is for when you're **introducing** something or someone, like "Is bean í" (She is a woman) or "Is úll é" (It is an apple). Bí is for when you're **describing** something or someone, like "Tá sí ard" (She is tall) or "Tá sé blasta" (It is tasty). You'll learn the basics of both here, and later you'll learn some more about each of them!
